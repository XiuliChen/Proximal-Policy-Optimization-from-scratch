> Some background: olicy gradient algorithms typically have two steps. 
	> In the first step, transitions are gathered. 
	> In the second step the policy is improved. 
	> There are two main issues: how much experience should the agent gather before updating the policy and how to actually update the old policy to the new policy.

> therefore, the first step is to collect experience

> ppo.py: add collect_experience
	> def collect_experience()
