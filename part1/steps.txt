create main.py
	create a PPO obeject and call the ppo.learn()
create ppo.py
	Step1: define our initial policy (actor); and value function (critic)
create network.py
	A neural network module to use to define our Actor/Critic networks in the PPO model. 
	It contains a simple Feed-Forward Neural Network.

	# For now, we use the simple Feed-Forward Neural Network for our actor/critic networks
		# In future versions, we will add an policy_type variable for the PPO class
